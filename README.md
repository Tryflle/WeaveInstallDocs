# Installion Method for Weave Manager

  3. Add your mods to:
     - Unix: `~/.weave/mods`, create it if it does not exist.
     - Windows: Press Windows + R, then in the run dialogue type `%userprofile`, look for `.weave`, if it doesn't exist create it and inside make a folder called mods, the full path is `%userprofile%/.weave/mods`
  4. Run it and launch lunar then hit relaunch with Weave.
  5. Enjoy, if it works.
